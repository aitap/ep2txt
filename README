This program converts episodic StellarNet spectra to text files.

Usage:
	ep2txt <infile.ep1> <outfile.txt>
		- OR -
	ep2txt <infile.ep1> <outfile.txt> <c1> <c2> <c3> <c4>

where c1..c4 are manually set wavelength polynome coefficients,

	wavelength, nm = c3 + c1*i + c2*i*i + c4*i*i*i

Library usage:
Pass float[4] of wavelength coefficients (or NULL if you want to use the file)
and pointers to size_t number_of_spectra, float * wavelengths, ** intensities.
Intensities[i] will contain 2051 points of each captured frame (i).
After you're finished, don't forget to free the data:
free(wavelengths);
for (i = 0; i < num_spectra; i++) free(intensities[i]);
free(intensities);

On errors all memory the library may have allocated is freed but the contents
of the variables you passed to it are not defined.
